    <p style="font-family:courier;margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">
Hello, my name is Daniel Lee. I am 15 years old and I attend Rancho Bernardo High School. I love going outside and I enjoy spending time with my friends. 
I love playing and working together with my team. I also love eating food because I am always hungry. I love camping especially with my friends 
because we get to spend quality time without technology getting in our way. I love Jesus and my family.</p>

    <h1>  One of the places I love going out to is the beach. This is Bryce Canyon, a place I went over the summer.</h1>
