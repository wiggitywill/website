    <h1>   Ice Cream Maker 1.1.9 Project</h1>
    <p style="font-family:merriweather;margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;font-size: 80px;">
This is our first project from PLTW Lesson 1.1.9. The ice cream stand is on the bottom of the screen including images of 
the 2 different flavors and a drawing of cherries on the side. It tells the user the 2 scoops we have available (Minion Fever and Banana
Swirl) and that each scoop is 2 dollars and a cherry will cost an extra dollar. The program asks the user for their name, what flavor 
they want (flavor 1 or 2), how many scoops, and whether they want a cherry or not. If they user chooses a flavor other than #1 or 2, the program 
will continue to run until they pick correctly. They can add as many scoops as they want and no matter how high the last scoop is, a cherry will be 
added on top if they would like. Finally, the program calculates the total of the ice cream based on their scoops and additional cherry.</p>
