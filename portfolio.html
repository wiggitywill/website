    <h1>   Ice Cream Maker 1.1.9 Project</h1>
    <p style="font-family:merriweather;margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;font-size: 20px;">
This is our first project from PLTW Lesson 1.1.9. The ice cream stand is on the bottom of the screen including images of 
the 2 different flavors and a drawing of cherries on the side. It tells the user the 2 scoops we have available (Minion Fever and Banana
Swirl) and that each scoop is 2 dollars and a cherry will cost an extra dollar. The program asks the user for their name, what flavor 
they want (flavor 1 or 2), how many scoops, and whether they want a cherry or not. If they user chooses a flavor other than #1 or 2, the program 
will continue to run until they pick correctly. They can add as many scoops as they want and no matter how high the last scoop is, a cherry will be 
added on top if they would like. Finally, the program calculates the total of the ice cream based on their scoops and additional cherry.</p>

    <h1>   Piano Keys 1.2.5 Project</h1>
    <p style="font-family:merriweather;margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;font-size: 20px;">
This is our PLTW 1.2.5 Project called Piano Keys. The program will begin by gathering the user’s name and letting them know how the point system 
works in our game. 1 point will be deducted for every time you miss the turtles on the bottom(detectors) and added whenthe falling turtles match the turtles 
on the bottom(detectors). The detectors’ shapes are circles and the falling turtles are shiny blue squares. The detectors will change color if they
miss and will change or remain as black if they match it. A random turtle will fall, matching the beats to the music and will reset after reaching
a certain point. When the game/song ends, the total points will be calculated and revealed to the user.</p>
